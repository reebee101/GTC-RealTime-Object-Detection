# BDD100K â€” Object Detection with YOLOv8 ðŸŽ¯

**Goal:** train and evaluate a YOLOv8 model on the BDD100K dataset for autonomous driving scenarios.  
**Highlights:** âœ… Data preparation âœ… Model training (30, 50, 100 epochs) âœ… Evaluation âœ… Confusion matrices âœ… Real-world predictions

## ðŸ§­ Project overview

- **Dataset:** [BDD100K](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marquis03/bdd100k)  
- **Classes:** car, bus, truck, person, traffic light, traffic sign, bike, motor, train, other
- **Model:** YOLOv8

## âœ… What we did

### Phase 1 â€” Data Preparation & Feature Engineering ðŸ“‚
- Downloaded dataset (Kaggle: `marquis03/bdd100k`)  
- Converted annotations to YOLO format  
- Split into train/val/test sets
- Visualized data

### Phase 2 â€” Model Training âš¡
- **Epochs tested:** 30, 50, 100 

### Phase 3 â€” Evaluation ðŸ“Š
- **Training curves:** box_loss, cls_loss, dfl_loss steadily decreased  
- **Metrics:**  
  - mAP@50 improved from ~0.45 (30 epochs) â†’ ~0.56 (100 epochs)  
  - mAP@50-95 reached ~0.28 â†’ ~0.38  
  - Precision stabilized around 0.65â€“0.70  
  - Recall improved from ~0.35 â†’ ~0.53  

- **Confusion matrices:**  
  - Showed strong car detection, moderate for trucks & buses, weaker for small objects like pedestrians, bicycles, and traffic signs  

### Phase 4 â€” Predictions ðŸš€
- Tested on street images & dashcam frames  
- Successfully detected cars (high confidence), traffic signs, and lights

## ðŸ“Œ Key Learnings
- More epochs (100) significantly improved recall and mAP  
- Background class dominates â€” needs balancing  
- Small objects (traffic signs/lights) remain challenging  
- Real-world predictions confirm the model generalizes well
